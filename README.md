# Pepticide-Residue-Test-Device
This repository saves some code of software and schematics to use for the Pepticide Residue Test Device Project
The purpose of the project is  The sensors read some physical phenomena in sample such as conductivity, resistance, capacitance, Total solid dissolve material, and temperature. All of data send those value to the raspberry pi using SERIAL communication conducted by Microcontroller Arduino Uno R3. The program then send the data to MYSQL database. The program also displays the data to the monitor of the instruments. The program made in Python IDE 3.6
