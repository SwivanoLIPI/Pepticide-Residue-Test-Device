# Pepticide-Residue-Test-Device
This project is fully sponsored by the Center for Agricultural Research and Development of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia. 
The aim of this project is to create a tool that can detects concentration of waste in liquid quantitatively.
The key point to detect the waste is applied some sensors to read the values form some physical phenomena such as conductivity, resistance, capacitance, Total solid dissolve material, and temperature. 
In this project, those values is defined as raw data.
The raw data is collected by arduino and send to the raspberry pi by serial communication.
In raspberry pi, the raw data is filtered and processed by using some mathematical formulations. 
After processed, the data then displayed to the monitor as output data.
I also created mysql database to save output data in internet.
In this project, I use Python IDE 3.6 to create the main program and PYQT5 to create supported GUI program 

I also wants to give the thaks to mr. dito as the key person who bridging me to The Research and Development Center for Agricultural of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic Indonesia to make this project is realised.
