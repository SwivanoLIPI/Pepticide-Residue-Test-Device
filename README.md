# Pepticide-Residue-Test-Device
This Project is This project is fully sponsored by the Center for Agricultural Research and Development of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia. 
The aim of this project is to create a tool that detects the content of liquid waste quantitatively.
To detect concentration of the liquid waste, some sensors is applied to read some physical phenomena such as conductivity, resistance, capacitance, Total solid dissolve material, and temperature. 
This project is used raspberry pi and Arduino Uno R3 for data acqusition system. The raw data is collected by arduino and send to the raspberry pi by serial communication.
In raspberry pi, the raw data is filtered and processed by using some mathematical formulations. 
After processed, the data then displayed the data to the monitor.I also created mysql database to save the data in internet.
In this project use Python IDE 3.6 to create the main program and PYQT5 to create GUI program 

I also wants to give the thaks for mr. dito as the person who build the bridge form Center for Agricultural Research and Development of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia to me to make this project is realised
